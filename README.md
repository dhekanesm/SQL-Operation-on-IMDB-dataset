# SQL-Operation-on-IMDB-dataset : Introduction
In this project we will build a MySQL database using the Internet Movie Database (IMDb) dataset. The dataset consists of 7 compressed tab-separated-value (*.tsv) files, which are explained and available for download from https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/  and also the respective database file is also added in the repository
The data is refreshed daily, although the data used in this project was obtained on 29/11/2019

The purpose of this project is to do the following:
1. Learn about and use the database management system MySQL.
2.	Learn the essentials of database design, e.g., Entity-Relationship diagrams, logical schema, and database normalization.
3.	Practice database querying by posing basic and more advanced queries using MySQL directly and also indirectly using python.
4.	Visualize IMDb data using python.

The tangible steps we will take in this project are:
1.	Understand the data in the IMDb dataset.
2.	Design a relational database and store the IMDb data in it.
3.	Model the database using an Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram.
4.	Perform normalisation and restructure the IMDb data using python.
5.	Create MySQL database.
6.	Load data into the database.
7.	Add primary and foreign key constraints.
8.	 Create database indexes.
9.	Ask questions of the IMDb data, so as to practice simple and more advanced SQL queries.
Perform further exploration and also visualization of the data using python.
