# SQL-Operation-on-IMDB-dataset
In this project we will build a MySQL database using the Internet Movie Database (IMDb) dataset. The dataset consists of 7 compressed tab-separated-value (*.tsv) files, which are explained and available for download from here. The data is refreshed daily, although the data used in this project was obtained on 29/11/2019
